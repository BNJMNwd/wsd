<div id="halleydetail"> 
	<p>Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, 
	promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used 
	parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets actually orbited the Sun, 
	and assumed they must instead follow straight paths through the Solar System.
	In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Principia, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly
	 incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and 
	 after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), he was unable to completely reconcile comets into
	  his model. Ultimately, it was Newton's friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets,
	   used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits. This calculation enabled him,
	    after examining historical records, to determine that the orbital elements of a second comet which had appeared in 1682 were nearly 
	    the same as those of two comets which had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler).[19] 
	    Halley thus concluded that all three comets were in fact the same object returning every 76 years, a period that has since been amended 
	    to every 75â€“76 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the 
	    planets, he predicted its return for 1758.
	Halley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, 
	a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having 
	caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French
	 mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. Halley himself did not live to see the comet return, as he died in 1742. 
	 The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. I
	 t was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. 
	 The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.</P>

<section id="maincontent"> 

			<p>Comets are usually not visible to our eyes unless they are near the sun. When the comet gets close to the sun, 
			it heats up and spews dust and gases into a giant glowing head larger than most planets. The dust and gases form a tail
			 that stretches away from the sun for millions of kilometers. </p>  
	 		
	 		<p>Astronomers state that comets formed around 4.6 billion years ago when the solar system was born. They contain a mix of
	 		 frozen gases, rocks, ice and dust. Comets are sometimes called icy dirtballs. Because of their low mass, comets cannot
	 		  become round under their own gravity and will have irregular shapes. Comet nuclei are one of the darkest substances 
	 		  in the Universe they only reflect 4% of light. For a reference, asphalt reflects 7% of light. They orbit that sun 
	 		  in an elliptical pattern. There are short period comets, broken into the Jupiter family (less than 20 years) and the 
	 	  	Halley family (less than 200 years). There are also long- period orbits which are any comet that has an orbit lasting 
	 	  	longer than 200 years.</p>
